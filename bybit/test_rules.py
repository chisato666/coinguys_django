# The error message suggests that the `get_kline_data` method is not available in the BybitRest API client. This could be due to a few different reasons:
#
# - The method has been deprecated or removed in a newer version of the API.
# - The method is only available in a different API client or module.
# - There is a typo or other error in the method name or parameters.
#
# To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:
#
# 1. Check the version of the Bybit API that you are using and make sure that the `get_kline_data` method is still supported. You can check the official Bybit API documentation or contact their support team for assistance.
#
# 2. Double-check the spelling and parameters of the `get_kline_data` method call and make sure that they are correct. It's possible that there is a typo or other error in the code that is causing the method to not be recognized.
#
# 3. Consider trying a different API client or module that supports the `get_kline_data` method. For example, the `bybit` module provides a `fetch_ohlcv` method that can be used to retrieve historical price data.
#
# Here's an example of how you could use the `bybit` module to retrieve hourly price data and calculate the percentage change over the last hour:
#
# ```python
import os
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import bybit
import config

# Initialize Bybit API client
client=bybit.bybit(test=False,api_key=config.api_key, api_secret=config.api_secret)

# Define order parameters
symbol = 'BTCUSDT'
order_type = 'Limit'
qty = 100
price = None  # Will be set based on price movement
time_in_force = 'GoodTillCancel'
reduce_only = False
close_on_trigger = False
order_link_id = None

# Define price movement parameters
interval = 3600  # 1 hour in seconds
target_increase = 0.01  # 1%
tp = 0.02  # 2%
sl = -0.02  # -2%

# Define function to calculate target price
def calculate_target_price(current_price, target_increase):
    return current_price * (1 + target_increase)

# Define function to place conditional order
def place_conditional_order(side, target_price, tp, sl):
    global price
    if side == 'Buy':
        price = target_price
        take_profit = target_price * (1 + tp)
        stop_loss = target_price * (1 + sl)
    elif side == 'Sell':
        price = target_price
        take_profit = target_price * (1 - tp)
        stop_loss = target_price * (1 - sl)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid side '{side}'. Must be 'Buy' or 'Sell'.")
    response = client.place_conditional_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        side=side,
        order_type=order_type,
        qty=qty,
        price=price,
        base_price=price,
        stop_px=stop_loss,
        tp_price=take_profit,
        time_in_force=time_in_force,
        reduce_only=reduce_only,
        close_on_trigger=close_on_trigger,
        order_link_id=order_link_id
    )
    print(f"Placed {side} order: {response}")

# Main loop
while True:
    # Calculate start and end times for price data
    end_time = datetime.utcnow()
    start_time = end_time - timedelta(seconds=interval)

    # Get price data for the last hour
    response = client.fetch_ohlcv(symbol=symbol, timeframe='1h', since=start_time.timestamp() * 1000, limit=60)
    prices = [item[4] for item in response]

    # Calculate percentage change in price over the last hour
    price_change = (prices[-1] - prices[0]) / prices[0] if prices else 0
    print(f"Price change over the last hour: {price_change:.2%}")

    # Determine whether to place a buy or sell order based on price change
    if price_change >= target_increase:
        # If price increased by target amount, place buy order
        target_price = calculate_target_price(prices[-1], target_increase)
        place_conditional_order('Buy', target_price, tp, sl)
    else:
        # Otherwise, do not place an order
        print("Price change did not meet target increase. No order placed.")

    # Wait for next interval
    next_interval = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=interval)
    print(f"Waiting until {next_interval}...")
    sleep((next_interval - datetime.utcnow()).total_seconds())

#This script uses the `fetch_ohlcv` method from the `bybit` module to retrieve hourly price data for the last hour. It then calculates the percentage change in price over that time period and placesa conditional order to buy BTC if the price increased by at least 1% during the last hour. The order has a take profit target of 2% and a stop loss of -2%.

#Note that this script assumes that you have set the `BYBIT_API_KEY` and `BYBIT_API_SECRET` environment variables to your Bybit API credentials. You can obtain these credentials by creating an API key in your Bybit account settings. Also note that this is just an example script and does not include error handling or other best practices that you would want to include in a production system.
