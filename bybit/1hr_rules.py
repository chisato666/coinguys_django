#Sure, here's an example Python script that uses the Bybit API to place a conditional order based on the price movement of BTC:

import os
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import bybit
import config

# Initialize Bybit API client
#client = bybitRest(api_key=os.getenv('BYBIT_API_KEY'), api_secret=os.getenv('BYBIT_API_SECRET'))
client=bybit.bybit(test=False,api_key=config.api_key, api_secret=config.api_secret)

# Define order parameters
symbol = 'BTCUSDT'
order_type = 'Limit'
qty = 0.01
price = None  # Will be set based on price movement
time_in_force = 'GoodTillCancel'
reduce_only = False
close_on_trigger = False
order_link_id = None

# Define price movement parameters
interval = 3600  # 1 hour in seconds
target_increase = 0.01  # 1%
tp = 0.02  # 2%
sl = -0.02  # -2%

# Define function to calculate target price
def calculate_target_price(current_price, target_increase):
    return current_price * (1 + target_increase)

# Define function to place conditional order
def place_conditional_order(side, target_price, tp, sl):
    global price
    if side == 'Buy':
        price = target_price
        take_profit = target_price * (1 + tp)
        stop_loss = target_price * (1 + sl)
    elif side == 'Sell':
        price = target_price
        take_profit = target_price * (1 - tp)
        stop_loss = target_price * (1 - sl)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid side '{side}'. Must be 'Buy' or 'Sell'.")
    response = client.place_conditional_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        side=side,
        order_type=order_type,
        qty=qty,
        price=price,
        base_price=price,
        stop_px=stop_loss,
        tp_price=take_profit,
        time_in_force=time_in_force,
        reduce_only=reduce_only,
        close_on_trigger=close_on_trigger,
        order_link_id=order_link_id
    )
    print(f"Placed {side} order: {response}")

# Main loop
while True:
    # Get current BTC price
    response = client.get_ticker(symbol=symbol)
    current_price = response['last_price']
    print(f"Current price: {current_price}")

    # Calculate target price
    target_price = calculate_target_price(current_price, target_increase)
    print(f"Target price: {target_price}")

    # Determine order side based on current price
    if current_price >= target_price:
        place_conditional_order('Buy', target_price, tp, sl)
    else:
        place_conditional_order('Sell', target_price, tp, sl)

    # Wait for next interval
    next_interval = datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=interval)
    print(f"Waiting until {next_interval}...")
    sleep((next_interval - datetime.now()).total_seconds())

#This script sets up an infinite loop that repeatedly gets the current BTC price from the Bybit API, calculates a target price based on a 1% increase over the current price, and places a conditional order to buy or sell BTC depending on whether the target price has been reached. The order has a take profit target of 2% and a stop loss of -2%.

#Note that this script assumes that you have set the `BYBIT_API_KEY` and `BYBIT_API_SECRET` environment variables to your Bybit API credentials. You can obtain these credentials by creating an API key in your Bybit account settings. Also note that this is just an example script and does not include error handling or other best practices that you would want to include in a production system.
